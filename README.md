# Professional README Generator Starter Code

## Description

Professional README generator takes user inputs through inquirer.js prompts, and writes a new text file based on the input.

The text files Professional README Generator creates can be populated with:

<ul>
<li>A Table of Contents, with links that move the viewfield to the relevant section when clicked
<li>Title
<li>Description
<li>Installation Instructions
<li>Usage Information
<li>Contribution Guidelines
<li>Test Instructions
<li>License Information
<li>A 'Questions' section, including:
<ul>
<li>GitHub profile link
<li>Email link
</ul>
</ul>

This is currently a placeholder README, for developer use until the assignment is complete.
